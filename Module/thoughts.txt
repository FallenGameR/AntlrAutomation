Render trees simplified - text + children

Allow syntax like: FILE.some.sub.child (expand for all found children, discard the onces that don not have this path)?

Predefined samples:
- ini
- csv
- ping
- tracert
- whois
- diff?
- git?
- sd?
- logs?
- cs? (fuzzy)

Error handling:
- missing/extra token that is treated as recoverable error is a warning
- parser error recovery via "recovery stack" is treated as an error
- NoViableAltExceptions is as much verbose as possible
- Compilation warnings to warnings
- Compilation errors to errors. The grammar is discarded since it is not valid.
