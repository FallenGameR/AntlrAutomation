## Short grammars
## Set-Grammar

Allow syntax like: $file | % section | % sub

Parse-Items -tokens

Predefined samples:
- ini
- csv
- ping
- tracert
- whois
- diff?
- git?
- sd?
- logs?
- cs? (fuzzy)

Error handling:
- missing/extra token that is treated as recoverable error is a warning
- parser error recovery via "recovery stack" is treated as an error
- NoViableAltExceptions is as much verbose as possible
- Compilation warnings to warnings
- Compilation errors to errors. The grammar is discarded since it is not valid.
