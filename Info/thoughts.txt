Imaginary token autodetection

Parse-Items -tokens

Predefined samples:
- ini
- csv
- ping
- tracert
- whois
- diff?
- git?
- sd?
- logs?
- cs? (fuzzy)

Error handling:
- missing/extra token that is treated as recoverable error is a warning
- parser error recovery via "recovery stack" is treated as an error
- NoViableAltExceptions is as much verbose as possible
- Compilation warnings to warnings
- Compilation errors to errors. The grammar is discarded since it is not valid.

Other usages:
- Test scripts.
- DSL used for specific automation scripts.
- File batch edit.
- External program output processing.
- Log parsing.
- Prototyping.
- Smart IP filtering from the config files.
- Combine tracert and whoisinfo.
- Stack trace retrieval from logs.
- Subnet calculator and aggregator.
